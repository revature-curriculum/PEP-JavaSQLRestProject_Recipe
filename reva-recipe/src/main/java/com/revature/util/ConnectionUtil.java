/**
 * The ConnectionUtil class follows the singleton pattern, ensuring that 
 * only one instance of the ConnectionUtil object exists throughout the 
 * application. This class encapsulates the connection details such as 
 * username, password, and URL required for establishing database 
 * connections. It provides methods for configuring the connection 
 * parameters and obtaining a connection to the database.
 * 
 * The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside 
 * the class. The static method getInstance() provides a way to access 
 * the singleton instance, while the configure() method sets up the 
 * necessary parameters for the connection. It is important to call 
 * configure() only once to ensure the singleton is properly initialized.
